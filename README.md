# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native: the component renders blank even after a successful API call. The problem occurs despite the loading and error states working correctly.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API. While the loading and error states are displayed appropriately, the `FlatList` remains blank even when the API response is successfully parsed.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data provided to the `FlatList` component is properly structured and meets the requirements. It checks for the existence and appropriate structure of the fetched data and handles potential issues like empty arrays or null values gracefully. This helps to identify and resolve potential data-related issues that might cause the FlatList to render blank, even when the API call is successful.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`

Observe that the FlatList will not display any items, even if the API call is successful. The solution file provides a fix for this issue.
